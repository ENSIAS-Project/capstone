# Migration to 2 Availability Zones

## Date: 2025-10-28

## Summary

Reduced infrastructure from 3 Availability Zones (AZs) to 2 AZs to **minimize cost and complexity** while maintaining high availability.

---

## Rationale

### Why 2 AZs Instead of 3?

**Cost Savings:**
- Fewer subnets = simpler network management
- Still maintains high availability (99.99% uptime)
- AWS SLA requires minimum 2 AZs for multi-AZ

**Reduced Complexity:**
- Simpler architecture diagram
- Fewer route table associations
- Easier to understand and maintain
- Faster deployment

**Maintained Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ High availability still achieved
- ‚úÖ Fault tolerance across AZs
- ‚úÖ Load balancing across zones
- ‚úÖ Database multi-AZ still supported

### When is 3 AZs Needed?

3 AZs are typically needed for:
- **Mission-critical applications** requiring 99.999% uptime
- **Very high traffic** applications
- **Compliance requirements** mandating 3+ AZs
- **Global companies** with strict SLAs

For educational/testing purposes and most production workloads, **2 AZs is sufficient and recommended**.

## Changes Made

### Infrastructure Changes

#### Removed Resources (4 total)

**Networking:**
1. ‚ùå `aws_subnet.public_3` - Third public subnet
2. ‚ùå `aws_subnet.private_3` - Third private subnet
3. ‚ùå `aws_route_table_association.public_3` - Route table association
4. ‚ùå `aws_route_table_association.private_3` - Route table association

**Updated References:**
- ALB subnets: Now uses 2 public subnets (was 3)
- ASG vpc_zone_identifier: Now uses 2 private subnets (was 3)

#### Resources Count

| Component | Before (3 AZ) | After (2 AZ) | Savings |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| **Subnets** | 8 total | 6 total | -2 |
| **Route Associations** | 6 | 4 | -2 |
| **Total Resources** | ~35 | ~31 | **-4** |

### Architecture Comparison

## Cost Impact

### Cost Reduction

While the infrastructure cost doesn't change directly (ALB, RDS, NAT are per-resource, not per-AZ), there are indirect savings:

| Aspect | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| **Terraform operations** | Faster apply/destroy (fewer resources) |
| **Network traffic** | Slightly reduced cross-AZ traffic potential |
| **Management** | Simpler = less time = lower operational cost |
| **Scaling** | If scaling to 3+ instances, won't need extra AZ |

**No increase in costs, simpler architecture = win-win!**

---

## High Availability Analysis

### Is 2 AZ Enough?

**Yes!** Here's why:

#### AWS Availability Zones
- Each AZ is physically separate data center
- AZs connected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking
- Probability of multi-AZ failure is extremely low

#### Uptime Comparison

| Configuration | Expected Availability | Downtime/Year |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Single AZ | 99.9% | 8.76 hours |
| **2 AZ** | **99.99%** | **52.56 minutes** |
| 3 AZ | 99.995% | 26.28 minutes |

**Difference between 2 AZ and 3 AZ: Only 26 minutes per year!**

#### Failure Scenarios

**2 AZ Protection:**
- ‚úÖ Single AZ failure ‚Üí Traffic routes to healthy AZ
- ‚úÖ Single EC2 failure ‚Üí Auto Scaling replaces
- ‚úÖ ALB distributes across both AZs
- ‚úÖ RDS Multi-AZ failover to standby

**When 2 AZ Fails:**
- ‚ùå Both AZs down simultaneously (extremely rare)
- ‚ùå Regional AWS outage (3 AZ wouldn't help)

### Real-World Usage

Most AWS customers use **2 AZ** for:
- ‚úÖ Production web applications
- ‚úÖ E-commerce sites
- ‚úÖ SaaS platforms
- ‚úÖ APIs and microservices
- ‚úÖ Mobile app backends

## Testing Checklist

After migration, verify:

### Infrastructure Tests
- [ ] `terraform plan` shows 31 resources (was 35)
- [ ] No errors in terraform plan
- [ ] `terraform apply` completes successfully
- [ ] All subnets created in only 2 AZs
- [ ] ALB using 2 public subnets
- [ ] ASG instances launching in 2 private subnets

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] Application loads via ALB URL
- [ ] Both EC2 instances healthy in target group
- [ ] Database connection successful
- [ ] Can query data across all query types
- [ ] Auto Scaling still works

### Availability Tests
- [ ] Simulate AZ failure (stop instances in one AZ)
- [ ] Traffic should continue via remaining AZ
- [ ] Auto Scaling replaces failed instances
- [ ] No application downtime

---

## Deployment Instructions

### For New Deployments

Simply deploy as normal - the infrastructure is now 2 AZ by default:

```bash
# Upload PHP app
./upload-to-s3.sh

# Deploy infrastructure (now 2 AZ)
terraform init
terraform apply

# Import database
mysql -h $(terraform output -raw rds_address) -u admin -p country_schema < countries.sql
```

### For Existing Deployments

If you have an existing 3-AZ deployment, you have two options:

#### Option 1: Clean Redeployment (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Backup database
mysqldump -h $RDS_HOST -u admin -p country_schema > backup.sql

# 2. Destroy old infrastructure
terraform destroy

# 3. Deploy new 2-AZ infrastructure
terraform init
terraform apply

# 4. Restore database
mysql -h $NEW_RDS_HOST -u admin -p country_schema < backup.sql
```

**Downtime:** ~15-20 minutes

#### Option 2: In-Place Migration (Advanced)

```bash
# 1. Update Terraform files (already done)

# 2. Remove third AZ resources
terraform state rm aws_subnet.public_3
terraform state rm aws_subnet.private_3
terraform state rm aws_route_table_association.public_3
terraform state rm aws_route_table_association.private_3

# 3. Apply changes
terraform apply

# 4. Terminate instances in third AZ (Auto Scaling will rebalance)
```

**Downtime:** Minimal (rolling update)

**Note:** Option 1 is simpler and recommended for most users.

3. **Very high traffic** (millions of requests/second)
4. **Strict SLA** requirements (99.999% uptime)
5. **Global corporation** with enterprise support

For **learning, testing, small-to-medium production workloads: 2 AZ is perfect!**

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | 1 AZ | 2 AZ ‚úÖ | 3 AZ |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| **Availability** | 99.9% | 99.99% | 99.995% |
| **Complexity** | Low | Medium | Higher |
| **Cost** | Low | Medium | Higher |
| **Setup Time** | Fast | Fast | Slower |
| **Maintenance** | Simple | Simple | Complex |
| **Best For** | Dev/Test | Most production | Enterprise critical |
| **Recommended** | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | Only if needed |

---

## Monitoring & Alerting

With 2 AZ setup, monitor:

1. **AZ Distribution**
   - Check instances are balanced across AZs
   - Monitor for AZ-specific issues

2. **Auto Scaling**
   - Verify instances launch in both AZs
   - Check scaling events

3. **Database**
   - Monitor RDS Multi-AZ status
   - Check for failover events

4. **Load Balancer**
   - Monitor target health by AZ
   - Check cross-AZ traffic

---

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback to 3 AZ:

```bash
# 1. Revert Terraform files
git checkout HEAD~1 main.tf

# 2. Apply changes
terraform apply

# This will recreate the third AZ resources
```

**Time required:** ~5-10 minutes
